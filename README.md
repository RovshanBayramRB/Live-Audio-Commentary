In this project, I used many aspects of Python programming language such as its audio processing and playing libraries, and also Graphical User Interface (GUI) sides, namely, wavfile, Pygame, IPython, and Tkinter and wrote the code using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). Firstly, I created a graphical user interface in Python using Tkinter and Pygame library. When a user play an audio, the live plot of the audio is shown in the GUI depending on users' choice of playing, stopping, pausing, and restarting the chosen audio. While an audio is on or off, a user can enter a comment in any part of the audio. When the same or any other user tries to listen the same audio later, the comments which were previously entered are shown in the same second of the audio.
